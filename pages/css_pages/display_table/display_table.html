                            You'll rarely use a display value of table these days, but it's still important to know. It was more useful in the past because you would use it for layouts before the advent of floats, Flex, and Grid.
                            
                            Setting display to table makes the element behave like a table. So you can make a replica of an HTML table without using the table element and corresponding elements such as tr and td.
                            
                            For example, in HTML, you can make a table with the "table" element and also a "div", or any container of your choice.
